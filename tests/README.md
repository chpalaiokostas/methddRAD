## Assessing the accuracy of methddRAD

The methylation levels derived using methddRAD were compared to ones derived using EM-seq. The latter is considered a highly accurate approach for inferring methylation levels. Overall the methylation differences were estimated from 16 samples that were previously sequenced using EM-seq for library construction. More details about those samples can be found at the following: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41437-025-00756-y

The methylation differences are presented in the form histograms for each of those 16 samples (supplied here as pdfs).
